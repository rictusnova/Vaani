[Video](https://youtu.be/qrlN-ZdBfM4) 

Vaani is an Alexa-like virtual assistant device designed specifically for children. It leverages Flutter and TensorFlow image recognition technology to enable toy recognition, making it more engaging and interactive for children. The device also incorporates natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance its voice recognition capabilities, enabling it to understand and respond to a wide range of voice commands from children.

This project was developed at the InAE Youth Conclave Hackathon held at IIT Jodhpur.

## Technologies Used

Vaani was built using the following technologies:

- Flutter (for building the user interface)
- Python (for developing the machine learning models)
- YouTube API (for providing access to videos and content for children)

## Features

- Toy recognition using image recognition technology
- Voice-activated interface for controlling smart home devices
- Natural language processing and machine learning capabilities for understanding and responding to voice commands from children
- Access to age-appropriate videos and content through YouTube API integration

## Usage

Vaani is designed for use by children, providing a fun and engaging way to interact with technology and the world around them. Parents can set up the device and customize its features to suit their child's preferences. The device can be used to control smart home devices, access videos and content, and recognize different toys for interactive play.
